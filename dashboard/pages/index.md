# Sakila – SQL Lab
Welcome to my Sakila dashboard.

This is the start page for my solution to the Sakila SQL lab.  
Here I present results from my analysis of the Sakila database, where I explored movies, customers, revenue, and rentals.  
The dashboard makes it easy to spot patterns in the data and get a clear overview of my findings.

## What’s in the dashboard?

In the menu on the left, you will find the **Sakila** page.  
There I show:

- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the Sakila database  
- The SQL queries used in the lab  
- Tables and charts with insights about movies, customers, and rentals  
- Visualizations of popular films, active customers, and category revenue  

Each section includes both a chart and the SQL code behind it, making the results easy to follow.

**Or simply click here:**  [**Sakila**](/sakila)

This will take you to all analyses and visualizations.
